Hi, I am Sachin Tyagi!

I love to understand, build, and explain stuff.

My area of expertise include data engineering, distributed systems, and cloud platforms. Currently I head data engineering at Symmetry Systems where I work on building a scalable, fast, and cost-effective data and analytics platform.

Prior to Symmetry, I co-founded Optobizz, a fintech and compliance company focused on Indian small and medium business. At Optobizz, I built Optotax, a Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance product used by over 1 million Indian businesses to prepare, analyze, and file their tax returns.

Optotax was acquired by Open Financial Technologies, a neo-bank for Indian businesses. As VP of Engineering at Open, I worked on building core banking and compliance solutions.

I am a functional programming enthusiast and in my spare time I love to explore category theory and theory of programming languages. Outside of work, I enjoy running (both outdoors and after my kids) and playing, watching, and opining on cricket!
